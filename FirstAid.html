            Call 911 if:
            The person has been seriously wounded.
            Bleeding can't be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure.
            Bleeding is severe.
            Blood spurts from the wound.
            <hr />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Stop Bleeding<br />
                    Apply direct pressure until bleeding stops.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Clean and Protect<br />
                    For a wound or superficial scratch from an animal bite:

                    Gently clean with soap and warm water. Rinse for several minutes after cleaning.
                    Apply antibiotic cream to reduce risk of infection, and cover with a sterile bandage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Get Help<br />
                    Get medical help immediately for any animal bite that is more than a superficial scratch or if the animal was a wild animal or stray, regardless of the severity of the injury.
                    If the animal's owner is available, find out if the animal's rabies shots are up-to-date. Give this information to your health care provider.
                    If the animal was a stray or wild animal, call the local health department or animal control immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. Follow Up<br />
                    The health care provider will make sure the wound is thoroughly clean and may prescribe antibiotics.
                    The health care provider may numb the wound and look for any deeper damage.
                    If there is any risk of rabies infection, the health care provider will recommend anti-rabies treatment.
                    The person may require stitches, depending on how big the wound is and where it is located.
                    The person may also require a tetanus shot or booster.
                    The health care provider may recommend ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain.

        <h3 id="Bleed"><ins>Bleeding</ins></h3>
        <p>
            Call 911 if:
            Bleeding is severe
            You suspect internal bleeding
            There is an abdominal or chest wound
            Bleeding can't be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure
            Blood spurts out of wound
            <hr />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Stop Bleeding<br />
                    Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops.
                    If blood soaks through the material, don’t remove it. Put more cloth or gauze on top of it and continue to apply pressure.
                    If the wound is on the arm or leg, raise limb above the heart, if possible, to help slow bleeding.
                    Wash your hands again after giving first aid and before cleaning and dressing the wound.
                    Do not apply a tourniquet unless the bleeding is severe and not stopped with direct pressure.
                </li>

                <li>
                    2. Clean Cut or Wound<br />
                    Gently clean with soap and warm water. Try to rinse soap out of wound to prevent irritation.
                    Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which can damage tissue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Protect the Wound<br />
                    Apply antibiotic cream to reduce risk of infection and cover with a sterile bandage.
                    Change the bandage daily to keep the wound clean and dry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. When to Call a Doctor<br />
                    The wound is deep or the edges are jagged or gaping open.
                    The wound is on the person’s face.

                <li>
                    1. Cool Burn<br />

                    Hold burned skin under cool (not cold) running water or immerse in cool water until pain subsides.
                    Use compresses if running water isn’t available.

                <li>
                    2. Protect Burn<br />

                    Cover with sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.
                    Do not apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.

                <li>
                    3. Treat Pain<br />

                    Give over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or naproxen (Aleve).
                </li>

                    Immerse in cool water for 10 or 15 minutes.
                    Use compresses if running water isn’t available.
                    Don’t apply ice. It can lower body temperature and cause further damage.
                    Don’t break blisters or apply butter or ointments, which can cause infection.

                <li>
                    3. Prevent Shock<br />

                    Unless the person has a head, neck, or leg injury, or it would cause discomfort:

                    Lay the person flat.
                    Elevate feet about 12 inches.
                    Elevate burn area above heart level, if possible.
                    Cover the person with coat or blanket.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. See a Doctor<br />

                    The doctor can test burn severity, prescribe antibiotics and pain medications, and administer a tetanus shot, if needed.

                    Cover loosely with sterile, nonstick bandage or, for large areas, a sheet or other material that that won’t leave lint in wound.
                    Separate burned toes and fingers with dry, sterile dressings.
                    Do not soak burn in water or apply ointments or butter, which can cause infection.

        <ul>
            <li>First aid measures may prevent further heat loss and help the body slowly warm up.</li>
            <li>
                Remain calm. Fear or too much activity causes sweating. Sweating can make you feel chilled.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find shelter so you can get out of the cold, the wind, or the water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove cold, wet clothes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put on dry clothing, especially wool clothing or a synthetic fabric that insulates well, such as polypropylene. Cover your head.
            </li>
            <li>
                If dry clothing is not immediately available, you can try to get warm by making skin-to-skin contact. After removing wet clothes, wrap a blanket or sleeping bag around you and another person and allow body heat to rewarm you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Warm up under a heated blanket, if available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move around, but don't be so active that you sweat. Whirl your arms around like a windmill to get your blood moving and warm you up. Activity makes body heat and improves blood flow. Sweating should be avoided because it cools the body.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drink warm fluids that do not contain caffeine or alcohol. Eat high-energy foods, such as candy. Do not give food or drink to a person who is acting confused or responding slowly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to avoid putting your whole body in warm water. As a last resort, use a warm-water bath [100.4°F (38°C) to 105°F (41°C)] to rewarm if help is not available and other home treatments are not working to warm you up. Small body parts, such as a hand or foot, can be rewarmed by putting them in warm water. Do not put anyone who is not fully awake and alert into a warm bath.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not use tobacco.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be aware that if you (or the person) sit in front of a heater or a fire to warm up, there is a greater chance of getting burned. This is because normal feeling is lost in cold-injured skin, and you may not know when to move away from the heater or fire.
            </li>
            <li>
                If small areas of your body (ears, face, nose, fingers, or toes) are really cold or frozen, try these first aid measures to warm the areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid activities that can further damage cold-injured skin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not rub or massage frozen skin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not rewarm frozen skin if refreezing is possible. Wait until you reach shelter. The injury will be worse if your skin freezes, thaws, and then refreezes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not walk on frozen feet if possible. However, it is better to walk on frozen feet than to thaw your feet if there is a chance they will refreeze.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not put snow on the area or pack snow around the limb.
            </li>
            <li>
                Warm small areas of the body by:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Blowing warm air onto cold hands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tucking hands or feet inside warm clothing next to bare skin. Place chilled fingers in an armpit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cupping cold ears with warm hands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Putting cold hands, feet, or ears in warm water [104°F (40°C) to 108°F (42°C)] for 15 to 30 minutes. Do not use water above 108°F (42°C). Warm towels can be used to warm the genital area but be careful not to burn the skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using a hot water bottle covered with a cloth or a heating pad on a low setting. Be careful not to burn your skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>  Protect the cold or frozen body part from further cold exposure and bruising. Pad frozen fingers or toes. Gently wrap fingers or toes in soft, dry material, such as cotton or gauze.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
