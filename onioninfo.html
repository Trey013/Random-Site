        This page is a collection of random information both pertaining to and aquired from the Onion Router.
    </article>
    <ol type="I">
        <li style="color:violet">  If you see someone refer to a site called half chan, its 4chan refered to by 8chan members. Im not posting the link because 4chan is for pedos and other various worthless pieces of shit. if you want to find the site, i recommend shooting yourself in the face after chugging a bottle of draino and asking the other pedos in hell what the address is. btw be careful as hell on 8chan. there is some real fucked up shit on there. A lot of useful information too but also some real fucked up shit. <a href="https://oxwugzccvk3dk6tj.onion">8Chan</a>
        <li>Also, everyone on 8chan refers to each other as either newfags or oldfags. fuckin wierd group of people on there but either way, like i said earlier, there is some useful info, just stay away from the porn boards. you may wind up seein some shit you werent ready for.
        <li style="color:red">For all the hackers out there you have several options when it comes to TOR. GroundZero isnt bad but it is still under construction as of 04/09/16. You will also need to "prove yourself" by hacking a target sent to you by the site admins. HELL is another hacker forum but you will need to reach out to someone for an invite. I wont be telling you how to get that invite code. Just do some networking until you find another member of HELL with a code they can send you. There are a few other hack forum sites that i may or may not post later on in this page but these two are the most highly recommended by the TOR community.
        <li style="color:orange"> There are also a veriety of DoxBins on TOR. You can upload a file and you will be given a link to access that file so you can share it. You have the choice of when that file will be deleted and who can see it (on some sites you can't choose who can see it. Anyone with a link will be able to view the file you post.) I personally like <a href="https://piratexx3kbieklb.onion">ZeroBin</a> but again there are alot of choices out there for this type of thing.
        <li style="color:aqua">One of my personal favorites is <a href="https://rrcc5uuudhh40z3c.onion">Intel Exchange</a>.Here you will find a lot of information about various subjects and the best part is there is absolutely no CP on this site. The only downside is that you <ins>can not</ins> post or respond to a post until you are a verified user. The steps for this may have changed (Its been several years since I was verified) so please refer to the site for instructions. It may take a while to get verified but you can still read everything on the site without verification. I do however recommend being verified asap because you will be able to communicate with people from all over the world who share your intrests. Unlike social media it is not a social site just a forum but with alot of interesting conversations and tons of very useful info about TOR and alot of other subjects.
        <li style="color:aliceblue">One of the most important things to have when surfing the Darknet is an anonymous email. The best plae to get one is <a href="https://sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion">Sigaint</a>. You never know what or who you may stumble into out there and having an email account is vital to making connections and creating accounts on all of your favorite sites. <strong>DO NOT EVER USE A CLEARNET EMAIL ADDRESS ON TOR!!!</strong>EMail addresses like Gmail, Yahoo, Aol, etc., all have your name and person information attached to them. The also have locations and IP addresses all connected to you. Providing a clearnet email for account creation and personal interactions allows <strong>EVERYONE</strong> to see who and exactly where you are. Your identity could be stolen in a matter of minutes. Literally before you can even get off the site. This is not a joke or an exaggeration. There are some world class hackers out there. Don't be a dumb ass.
